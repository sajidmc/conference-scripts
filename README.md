# conference-scripts
As volunteers we need to organize conferences for our professional community. I want to archive some scripts for tedious tasks for the conference in this repository.


## batchrename.py - Microsoft CMT File Renamer
This Python script is specifically written for submission files downloaded from Microsoft CMT. 
It renames the files and puts them in the root folder.
### Usage: 
1. Download the submissions from Microsoft CMT
2. Extract the zip file to a folder (such as C:\Users\Sajid\Downloads\Submissions)
3. Copy the path of the folder and change it in the root_folder_path variable
4. Execute the script.
